# SmashDiscordBot
Discord Bot, discord.py. My introduction to learning Python, coupled with one of my all time favorite games, Super Smash Bros.

Bot meant to return frame data information about characters in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, with frame data from Ultimate Frame Data, and other associated databases online.

Also will return Spotify or youtube playlists from the specified character's series of game. For example, !Joker would return information about Joker in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and would return a playlist from spotify or youtube from his game, Persona 5.
